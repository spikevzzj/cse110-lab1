## Something Deeper
In order to success, I believe these things are mandatory(from most important to the least):
1. Perseverance
2. Source
3. Luck
4. Talent

But in the real life, success does not matter since I believes that only these things really matters in our life:
1. Happiness
2. Health
3. Family
4. Lovers
5. Friends
